I am a Michigan Data Science Fellow jointly appointed at the Michigan Institute for Data & AI in Society (MIDAS) and the Department of Industrial & Operations Engineering (IOE), University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My research blends *advanced analytics* and *machine learning* to improve operational and clinical decision-making, with current projects on maximizing the use of lower-quality donor kidneys and optimizing operating-room schedules.  ￼ ￼

Previously, I earned a PhD in Management Science (2023) at the University of Ottawa, where my dissertation focused on learning-based planning and scheduling in healthcare. My work has been recognized with two Ontario Graduate Scholarships (2020 & 2021).  ￼

Beyond research, I serve as Postdoctoral Affairs Co-chair for the University of Michigan Postdoctoral Association and Student Liaison for the INFORMS Healthcare Applications Society, striving to bridge academia, practice, and trainee support. When I’m not coding or poring over transplant data, you can catch me playing soccer, kayaking the Huron River, or debating meta-heuristics on r/MachineLearning -- my favorite subreddit.
